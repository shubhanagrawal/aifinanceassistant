## **Tech Stack (Production-Grade Decisioning)**

---

## **Programming Language**

**Python 3.11+**
Reason:

* Finance ecosystem maturity
* AI ecosystem maturity
* Clean ecosystem
* Stable library support

---

## **Core Frameworks**

### **Backend Framework**

**FastAPI**
Why:

* Fast
* Async support
* Industrial grade
* Built-in validation
* Clean structure

---

### **Frontend**

**Streamlit**
Why:

* Fast to build
* Clean UI
* Minimal frontend complexity
* Professional enough

Future Upgrade:

* React + API
* Dashboard evolution

---

## **Data Libraries**

* **pandas** — structured financial handling
* **numpy** — number crunching
* **pydantic** — strict data models

---

## **Finance APIs**

Primary:

* **yfinance**
* **NSEpy** (India-specific)

Optional Expansion:

* Finnhub
* AlphaVantage
* Tiingo

---

## **News + Intelligence**

* NewsAPI
* Custom scrapers later
* NLP lightweight processing

---

## **Language / Reasoning Layer**

LLM-agnostic design

* modular reasoning wrapper
* allows:

  * OpenAI
  * Local models
  * Hybrid reasoning

---

## **Infrastructure**

Phase-1:

* Local dev
* GitHub repo
* Deployment using:

  * Render / Railway / HuggingFace Spaces

Phase-2:

* Docker
* CI/CD
* Cloud deployment
* Observability

---

## **Logging & Monitoring**

* Python logging module
* Structured logs
* Request logs
* Failure logs

Future:

* Sentry / Logtail integration

---

## **Security**

* `.env` for secrets
* `.env.example` checked in
* Never commit keys
* Safe request handling

---

## **Testing**

* pytest
* minimal but meaningful coverage

---

## **Coding Standards**

* PEP8
* typed hints
* docstrings required
* no garbage code

---

## **Why This Stack Is Production-Grade**

Because it is:

* pragmatic
* stable
* scalable
* cleanly maintainable
* industry aligned
* avoids hype tech debt

This stack passes:

* recruiter inspection
* senior engineer inspection
* real-world usability inspection

---

## **Success Criteria**

Tech stack is correct if:

* system remains stable
* features are extendable
* team can maintain it
* performance remains reasonable
* developer experience is good
