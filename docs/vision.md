## **AI Finance Research Assistant — Vision Document**

### **Purpose**

Build a practical, intelligent, and reliable **AI-powered Financial Research Assistant** that behaves like a disciplined financial analyst — not a gambling bot, not a hyped trading system.
The assistant should **analyze, reason, explain, and inform**, using real market data and structured logic.

## **Core Objective**

Create a system that:

* Understands a financial question or request
* Automatically gathers relevant market, company, and news data
* Analyzes context instead of predicting blindly
* Produces structured, transparent, explainable insights

* Cites sources and avoids hallucinations

This project focuses on **intelligence quality > hype**.
